# This project was done by request. It was written in Visual Basic using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013,           
# and took about a week to finish (if you don't include the one-year gap of inactivity).

# I made this open source, so if you want to dig into the code out of curiosity, or to use it for your own       
# project(s), you're welcome to do that. Detailed comments are used throughout the program to make it easy       
# to understand.

# It is essential that, when you unzip the contents of the program, you keep everything in the "RB4 Tier Maker"  
# folder intact. The reason for this is because these files are accessed by the program to store settings, as    
# well as read from the font files. So, in simple terms, make sure the Sys folder is in the same directory       
# as the .exe!

# 		-Hides the preview, and makes the window much smaller and not take up your entire screen.          
# 		***IMPORTANT: If your screen resolution's width is less than 1440, the preview will not fit        
# 			and it will be hidden by default, with the "Show Preview" option disabled. The reason          
# 			for this is because Windows Forms cannot create a window size larger than your resolution,     
# 			so there would be visual errors in the preview.
